# Problem statement

Each year, billions of birds migrate across continents, following specific routes between breeding and wintering grounds. Understanding these migration routes is essential for conservation efforts, as it allows scientists and conservationists to identify critical habitats, understand the impact of climate change, and mitigate threats to migratory bird populations, such as habitat loss, pollution, and collision with man-made structures. Traditional tracking methods, such as satellite tags or banding, are often limited in scope due to high costs, difficulty in tagging large numbers of birds, and risks to the birds themselves.
